# Bootstrap Themepack #

`preview.html` is a preview of the flat-light theme (further themes will come)

`theme.compiled.css` is the compiled CSS you need to include **after** Bootstrap to override the default theme.

**Note:** This repo is still being developed, and not every BS element may be styled if you use the theme at this time.
